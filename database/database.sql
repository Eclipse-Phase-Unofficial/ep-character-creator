You believe power is always corrupting and everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive policies of the inner system and Jovian Junta, this makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a ter- rorist at worst.

INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(2,'Ape Uplift','Neo-gorillas and neo-orangutans have integrated well with transhumanity, but they still haven''t shaken their reputation for aggressiveness. Your drive to be in control of your social group and environment-- a remnant of your species'' social competitiveness and group hierarchies--chafes at the prejudice and restrictions you find in most habitats. Due to your perceived "anti-social tendencies," it can be difficult to find a place in society outside of military, police, or criminal organisations.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Hominid, Neo-Hominid\n(Gorillas) (p. 143, Panopticon)','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(3,'Argonaut','You are part of a scientific technoprogressive movement that seeks to solve transhumanity''s injustices and inequalities with technology. You support universal access to technology and healthcare, open-source models of production, morphological freedom, and democratization. You try to avoid factionalism and divisive politics, seeing transhumanity splintering as a hindrance to its perpetuation.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All','FAC');

INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(7,'Bonobo Uplift','Your species is among the most enthusiastic when it comes to assimilating into transhuman cultures, and you are no exception. The large, vibrant social groups, the constant interaction, and the pervasive--if unspoken--focus on sex and sexuality makes your own impulses and tendencies an almost perfect fit. Although other uplifts might belittle you for pandering to transhumans, and some transhumans claim you''re too naÃ¯ve to realize the way your uplifters moved your species towards work in entertainment, XP, and porn, you actually have many more opportunities and wider acceptance than almost any other uplifts except your cousins the chimps. So long as you have friends--and if you''re lucky, family--to share this life with, you''re happy.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Neo-Hominid, Pleasure Pod, Sylph','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(8,'Brinker','You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of the trans- humanity and the various goings-on in the rest of the system. Your particular grouping may have sought out self-imposed isolation to pursue their own interests, or they may have been exiled for their unpopular beliefs. Or you may simply be a loner who prefers the vast emptiness of space to socializing with others. You might be a religious cultist, a primitivist, a utopian, or something altogether uninterested in transhumanity.<br><br>\n<b> Common Morphs:</b> All','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(9,'Cetacean Uplift','You are used to living with a tight-knit pack that had no secrets. Like others of your kind, you are always in motion, always expressive, and quite often playing tricks and games. As an aquatic creature, there are only a few locations that you can call home, if you want to thrive in your natural form.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Beluga, Neo-Dolphin,\nNeo-Orca, Neo-Porpoise, Neo-Whale (pp. 142-143, Panopticon)','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(10,'Chimp Uplift','You come from the first and most populous uplifted species, and the one generally perceived as closest to humans. As a chimp, you dont suffer from the same level of scorn as other species and have more possi- bilities for success, but your life is still limited by laws and prejudice throughout the system. Will you work to push for more rights and recognition for all species or take advantage of the slim acceptance you enjoy to live an easier life than other uplifts?\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Hominid','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(11,'Corvid Uplift','You have all the best and worst tendencies of your species: excellent three- and four-dimensional thinking, a knack for finding objects you can put to use, and an unfortunate and overwhelming habit of adding new things to your nest.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Chickcharnie (p. 142,\nPanopticon), Neo-Avian, Ripwing (p. 151, Gatecrashing)','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(12,'Criminal','You are involved with the crime-oriented underworld. You may work with one of the Sol system''s major criminal factions--triads, the Night Cartel, the ID Crew, Nine Lives, Pax Familae--or one of the smaller, local operators with a big stake in a specific habitat. You might be a vetted member-for-life, a reluctant recruit, or just a freelancer looking for the next gig.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(13,'Drifter','You were raised with a social grouping that remained on the move throughout the Sol system. This could have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers, scavengers, or just migrant workers. You are used to roaming space travel between habitats and stations. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All, especially Bouncers and Hibernoids','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(14,'Emergent Agi Uplift','<b>must start with an infomorph / eidolon</b><br><br>\nAs a pre-sapient complex software system, you may have emerged into full intelligence on your own, given enough time. Your potential was recognized, however, and you were "uplifted" with an upgraded, human- based neural network and a program of socialization to make you friendly and conducive to human values and modes of thought. You are not quite as assimilated as programmed AGIs, however. While you are at least capable of functionally interacting with transhumans, their thought processes and social behaviors are quite often a complete mystery to you. Many emergent uplifts also have the Anomalous Mind trait.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorph/Eidolon','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(15,'Europan','As a Europan, you consider your home the most enlightened polity in Jovian space. You value science and a technoprogressive agenda, while opposing the bioconservatism of the Junta and its dominance around Jupiter. The ocean depths are the focal point of your interests and culture.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cetus (p. 185, Rimward),\nEuropan biomorph variants (p. 188, Rimward), Selkie (p. 187, Rimward)','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(16,'Exhuman','Humanity is weak, and you intend to elevate your body and mind to a superior state of existence. You embrace new and developing technologies, no matter how dangerous and untested, to perfect your physical form and upgrade your mind. You intend to survive and dominate, no matter the cost.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any, but heavily modified','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(17,'Extropian','You are an anarchistic supporter of the free market and private property. You oppose government and favor a system where secu- rity and legal matters are handled by private competitors. Whether you consider yourself an anarcho-capitalist or a mutualist (a differ- ence only other Extropians can figure out), you occupy a middle ground between the hypercorps and autonomists, dealing with both and yet trusted by neither.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(18,'Fall Evacuee','You were born and raised on Earth and evacuated during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life (and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones) behind you. You were lucky enough to survive with your body intact and continue to make a life for your- self out in the system.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flats, Splicers','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(19,'Feral Uplift','<b>must start with an uplift biomorph</b><br><br>\nBy design or accident, your uplift moved you to full sapience but did nothing to change your instincts or social impulses. The morality and social behaviors of other transhumans are a mystery and only worth understanding to the extent needed for your own survival. You will do as you must to survive, but you long to live the way your natural impulses dictate. Many feral uplifts also have the Anomalous Mind trait.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b>Any uplift biomorph','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(20,'Humanities Infolife','Your digital mind emulates human minds and values as closely as your neuroprogrammers could make it. You were specifically designed to blend in with transhumans and work closely with them.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorph/Eidolon, Basic Pod, Pleasure Pod, Specialist Pod','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(21,'Hypercorp','You hail from a habitat controlled by the hypercorps. You might be a hypercapitalist entrepeneur, a hedonistic socialite, or a lowly vacworker, but you accept that certain liberties must be sacrificed for security and freedom.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Exalts, Olympians, Splicers, Sylphs','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(22,'Hyperelite','You are privileged to have been raised as part of the immortal upper class that rules many inner system habitats and hypercorps. You were pampered with wealth and influence that most people can only dream of.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Exalts, Sylphs','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(23,'Indenture','You may have handed yourself over to the hyper-corps before the Fall, going off-world to escape a life of violence and misery on Earth, or you may have escaped the horrors of the Fall as an infugee. Either way, you left Earth with nothing, and you spent years selling your time and labor as an indenture. Now you''ve earned your freedom and are taking your first cautious steps back into transhuman society as your own person. You might only have a dim understanding of current events and culture--your activities and news sources were heavily restricted during your indenture--but your work has helped you sharpen some skills and come away with a decent understanding of new corporate culture.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Splicers, Rusters','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(24,'Infolife','You entered existence as a digital consciousness-- an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Your very existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs). Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you do have full autonomy.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Infomorphs, synthetic morphs','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(25,'Isolate','You were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on the fringes of the system. Whether raised as part of a religious group, cult, social experiment, anti-tech cell, or a group that just wanted to be isolated, you spent most if not all of your upbringing isolated from other factions.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(26,'Jovian','Your faction is noted for its authoritarian regime, bioconservative ideologies, and militaristic tendencies. Where you come from, technology is not to be trusted and humans need to be protected from themselves. To ensure its survival, humanity must be able to defend itself and unfettered growth must be checked. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flats and Splicers','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(27,'Lost','You are a legacy of one of the most infamous debacles since the Fall. As a member of the Lost generation, you went through an accelerated-growth childhood, somehow surviving where others of your kind died, went insane, or were persecuted.<br>\nYour background is a social stigma, but it does provide you with certain advantages ... and burdens. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Futuras','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(28,'Lunar','You hail from Luna, the original off-Earth colony world. Now overpopulated and in decline, Luna is one of the few places where people still cling to old- Earth ethnic and national identities. Your home is also within sight of Earth, a constant reminder that encourages many "Loonies" to be reclaimers, deploring the hypercorp interdiction and arguing that you have a right to return to Earth, terraform it, and re-establish it as a living homeworld.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Exalts, Flats, Splicers, Synths','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(29,'Lunar Colonist','You experienced your childhood in one of the cramped dome cities or underground stations on Luna, Earth''s moon. You had a ringside seat to the Fall of Earth.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Flats, Splicers','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(30,'Machine Infolife','You were programmed to facilitate transhumanity''s interactions with complex systems. You understand computers, robots, and machines more than you do transhumance.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorph/Eidolon, Specialist\nPod, Synth, Worker Pod','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(31,'Maker Nomad','The sparsely settled high desert of northern Mars is your homeland--one your people are slowly converting into a new home for transhumanity. You''ve been raised from childhood to be a consummate engineer while respecting the delicate balance of the evolving Martian climate. The sufi nomads are allies, and perhaps blood relations, to your maker clan. Your upbringing gives you an edge at surviving on improvisation in the harshest of climes.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Dragonfly, Martian Alpiner\n(p. 162, Sunward), Ruster','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(32,'Martian','You were raised in a station on or above Mars, now the most populated planet in the system. Your home town may or may not have survived the Fall. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flats, Splicers, and Rusters','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(33,'Mercurial','Your faction has no interest in co-opting their true natures in order to become more "human." You might be an AGI that does not necessarily intertwine its destiny with transhumanity or an uplift that seeks to preserve and promote non-human life (or at least your own species). You might even be an infomorph or posthuman who has strayed so far from transhuman interests and values that you now consider yourself to be forging a unique new path of life.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorphs, Synths, uplift morphs','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(34,'Neanderthal Uplift','Until a few decades ago, your species was extinct. The first resurrected neo-neanderthals had no pre-existing culture to build upon, but that hasn''t stopped your kind from inventing something new, even if you really are just making it up as you go along.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neanderthal (p. 162,\nSunward), Splicer','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(35,'Octopus Uplift','Yours is the least-human uplifted species. More so than other uplifts, you think and live a step apart from transhuman norms. By nature inclined to solitude and a restful, reactive life, the frenetic pace and hyperac- tive socializing of most transhumans is strange and off-putting. You must work to engage with others as a new type of protective camouflage, lest you be left isolated, exposed, and out-competed.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flying Squid, Octomorph,\nTakko (p. 144, Panopticon)','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(36,'Orbital','You still call Earth your home, though you never set foot there--you watch it from above, planning one day to return. Orbital society is a mash-up of Earth cultures that cling to their old ways and traditions. Progress isn''t as important to you as remembering where you came from.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Splicers, Synths','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(37,'Original Space Colonist','You or your parents were part of the first "generations" of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to stake a claim in space, so you are familiar with the cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older stations and habitats. As a "zero-one g" (zero-gravity, first-gen), you were never part of the elite. People from your background typically have some sort of special- ized tech training as vacworkers or habtechs. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All. Use of exotic morphs is common','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(38,'Outster','You have made your home in the far outer reaches of the solar system, living among others that no longer have interest in transhuman affairs and are methodically sloughing off their old ways. You may be intent on leaving the solar system for good, diving into a new virtual existence, or pursuing some other private or unusual interest far away from others.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Bouncers, Flexbots, Infomorphs','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(39,'Parrot Uplift','You have an easier time than most other uplift species when dealing with transhumans, as parrots were often viewed as smart and beautiful companion animals. As most people have positive stereotypes that you''ll be gregarious and entertaining, it''s easier to get on in life, but that also requires playing in to those stereotypes with funny impressions, non-sequiturs, and keeping your plumage bright.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Neo-Avian','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(40,'Pig Uplift','You have more of a place in society than many uplifts. Although your species was only recently uplifted, it has quickly become widespread because you make excellent workers. Pigs are smart, dedicated, have excellent memories, and can pick up trades quickly. You left the lab with some in-demand skills, an honest shot at a job, and a way to take care of yourself. There''s still discrimination, and you have to watch for some legal restrictions here and there, but by sticking to the right habs and keeping your snout down there''s a good life if you work for it.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Neo-Pig (p. 143, Panopticon)','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(41,'Precautionist','You take a stance between the bioconservatives and technoprogressives: technology should be proven safe, before it is widely adopted. You favor restricting access to new technologies, offering incentives for hypercorps to pursue thorough safety tests, and harshly punishing those who recklessly deploy dangerous tech.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any','FAC');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(42,'Re-Instantiated','You were born and raised on Earth, but you did not survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body died there, but your backup was transmitted offworld, and you were one of the lucky few to be reinstantiated with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave. <br><br>\n<b> Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Infomorphs, Synths','ORI');
INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(43,'Reclaimer','To your point of view, transhumanity is nothing without its homeworld. Reclaiming Earth from the machines isn''t just important for self-identity, it''s proof that transhumanity can overcome its obstacles and claim its place in the universe.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any','FAC');

INSERT INTO backgrounds VALUES(46,'Sapient','You believe that uplifts and AGIs are as much a part of transhumanity as humans, and therefore deserve equal rights and liberties. In the same vein, you uphold that all life has value and that the personhood of all sapient creatures should be recognized.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any','FAC');

In the rare circumstances that such a relic is found, the adaptive interface is the tool designed to enable transhumans to understand, activate, and potentially interact with it. <br><br>\nThis medium-sized device includes a series of smart-material connectors that allow this unit to be connected to almost any conceivable piece of tech- nology. It is also equipped with sensors and a small nanoswarm that can analyze the device''s structure and otherwise try to discern its inner workings. Once connected, the adaptive interface sends minute amounts of power into the alien device, monitors all outputs, and systematically attempts to identify and map the circuitry and logic patterns in the device as well as the safe amount and type of current used to power it. The interface''s AI compares the scans and any detected data structures to databases of known and speculated designs (Academics: Computer Science 80, Academics: Electrical Engineering 80, Academics: Xenodata 60, Infosec 40, Interfacing 40, Programming 40).<br><br>\nAn adaptive interface can be set up to analyze on its own (use the AI''s skills) or a character can take advantage of it to conduct their own study (with the AI providing teamwork). Attempts to figure out how to activate or use an alien device, read data on a relic, figure out an item''s purpose, etc. are Task Actions with a suggested timeframe of at least 1 hour and quite possibly longer. The alien nature of most devices applies a -30 modifier to such tests. The gamemaster should adjust this timeframe and apply additional modifiers as appropriate to the device.<br><br>\nWhile engaged in probing an alien device, the adaptive interface enters into an offline mode, severing all wireless connections; this is safety feature to prevent the interface from spreading an infection to other devices.<br><br>\nThe primary limit on this unit is that it is not designed to work with biological technology or with nanotechnology considerably in advance of those available to transhumanity.

The ghostrider module has no control over the animal''s body but is fully wired into its sensorium as if it were living a real-time XP recording. An ego "sleeved" into an aquarium pet experiences being a fish, from the sensation of swimming to autonomic drives such as hunger and urination. Many of these sensations, such as the pleco''s rasping at the soft aquarium wood to which it clings with its sucker-like mouth or the koi''s constant rifling of filthy bottom gravel with its mouth, are deeply revolting to most transhumans. In addition, the animals used often have good hearing, meaning the sleeved ego can make out conversations outside the tank.Aquarium pets are physically helpless, as the ego cannot control the animal. The animal behaves instinctively, avoiding nets with a Fray skill of 40 in water, flopping around helplessly out of it. The ghostrider module imposes no modifiers to the ego''s mental stats and is usually connected to a cortical stack, but it has no access to control interfaces.<br><br>\nEgos unwillingly placed into an aquarium pet must make a WIL x 2 Test when first "sleeved" and every week thereafter. The ego takes 1d10 SV on a failed test. If the aquarium pet dies with the ego in it, the ghostrider module ceases running and may only be re-instanced from the cortical stack (if any). Most aquarium pets have a DUR of 1 or 2. The ghostrider module and stack take up enough space in these creatures that an observer who makes an Academics (Biology) Test or a Perception Test at -20 realizes the animal contains implants, though they won''t know what kind of implants. <br><br>\n<b>Skills:</b> Fray 40, Swimming 60<br>\n<b>Implants:</b> Access Jacks, Cortical Stack (optional), Ghost Rider Module','PEG',250,0,0,NULL,NULL,'EVERY','false');

As a result, even infomorphs must normally switch their attention between the various locations and vantage points they are observing. Watching multiple views of a single location is no problem and usually provides the character with between +10 to +30 to their Perception Tests. Viewing different locations at one time, however, is far more difficult and taxing, requiring a Detailed Perception Quick Action (p. 190, EP) for each.

INSERT INTO gear VALUES(424,'Petals','Petals is a term for a type of narrative hallucinogen, a nanodrug that hijacks the senses and takes the user on a game-like, highly immersive trip. Known by a myriad of intriguing names--Forgotten Hand, Darkly Selving, Inquisitive Green, to name a few--Petals are post-Fall society''s heroin--the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked. Petals almost always appear as nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects imme- diately. Flowers have 5-10 petals. Multiple users may share the experience if they take the Petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert.\nPetal experiences are like entire scenarios in and of themselves. Some take place entirely in the user''s mesh inserts (the user must cede control of their implants voluntarily; if they do not, the drug has no effect other than producing very low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), taking control of the character''s entop- tic displays, linking to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invading the character''s sensorium with AR "hallucinations." Others put the character into a near-comatose state during which they go on a head trip. Normally there is some kind of well-developed theme or plot to a Petal experience, although in some cases they just experience a stream of images.\nThough most societies seek to suppress Petals, new ones appear constantly, fueled by a persistent sub- culture of crafters and users. Petalcrafters view their work as an art form (or at least as really good enter- tainment), and the better Petals are lovingly crafted, hauntingly beautiful experiences--even if they''re also terrifying. The subculture of Petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-dura- tion flower to hardcore addicts who spend much of their time not on Petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties. From this subculture comes a lot of information on what various Petals look like and their effects. Because Petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and sometimes connections to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.\nPetals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called "sweets" by petal users. Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or fulfilling goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph sleeves.\nOn the negative side, some Petal trips go bad, inflicting 1d10 mental stress or more on the user. Perhaps worse, some Petals are loaded with malware that takes over the user''s mesh inserts and worse-- some sentinels even whisper of Petals carrying strains of the exsurgent virus.

INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(2,'Aquanaut','Aquanauts are environmentally adapted for underwater activities. They have seen a revival on exoplanets with habitable seas and oceans. Their heart rate slows while underwater, their skin includes a layer of blubber that retains heat, they store oxygen in their muscle tissue, and they do not suffer negative health effects from pressure changes. Additionally, their eyes have nictitating membranes and their corneas adjust to counter under-water refraction. Their hands and feet are webbed and they possess a transgenic swim bladder for controlling buoyancy. They can safely descend to about 200 meters depth (roughly 6 atmospheres of pressure) without suffering narcotic effects or other diving problems.','biomorph',30,40,50,20000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(3,'Arachnoids','Arachnoid robotic shells are 1-meter in length, seg- mented into two parts, with a smaller head like a spider or termite. They feature four pairs of 1.5-meter- long retractable arms/legs, capable of rotating around the axis of the body, with built-in pneumatic systems for propelling the bot with small leaps. The manipula- tor claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating movement. A smaller pair of manipulator arms near the head allows for closer handling and tool use. In zero-g environments, arachnoids can retract their arms/legs and maneuver with vectored air thrusters.','synthmorph',30,40,45,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(4,'Ariel','The surprising number of transhumans who chose to sleeve in Titan-adapted hulder morphs encouraged designers on Profunda to develop a Titan-adapted flyer. While the sturdy hulder morph is designed for nomadic herders, the ariel morph is designed by people who wish to survive by hunting. Individuals sleeved in the ariel morph can hunt and eat Titanian caribou, but they most often eat the smaller rabbit-like creatures that Profunda designers have also recently designed to live on Titan. Ariel morphs have exotic-looking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings. These morphs have also been used by a few daring transhumans to explore the upper cloud layers of both Saturn and Uranus.','biomorph',30,30,50,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(5,'Ayah','Despite the advances in biotechnology, the hyperelite still need caretakers for their children and infirm. The ayah pod morph is designed to fulfill all nurse and caretaker functions. Rather than trust lower- class transhumans, hyperelites prefer AGI servants sleeved into ayah morphs, especially in polities where\nAGIs have few, if any, legal rights. Ayahs are almost always female with pleasant but not stunningly beau- tiful features.\nMost of the enhanced features of an ayah are built under the hood, so to speak. Their enhanced olfactory capabilities help them monitor the health and emotional state of their wards, as well as alert them to potential environmental dangers. Their ability to withstand temperature extremes and survive without air for short periods helps them protect and rescue their charges in an emergency, such as a hull breach or a fire. Ayahs are often modified with bioweave armor and implanted weapons so they can act as a last line of defense against potential attackers.','podmorph',30,35,25,20000);

The design has since spread to those who wish to enjoy the advantages of sleeving in a synthmorph without the risk of brainhacking or who simply dislike the idea of using a cyberbrain (including some asyncs). Most models feature a stylized but transparent braincase, to show off the biocore''s main feature, but others appear to be ordinary synthmorphs from the outside; only a detailed physical examination can determine that it actually contains a living brain.','synthmorph',30,40,50,60000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(8,'Blackbird','When they''re seen at all, these morphs resemble a matte gray neo-corvid with many odd, sharp angles.

INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(13,'Chickcharnie','Another creation by the mad geniuses of the exoplanet Fortean (p. 94, Gatecrashing), this morph is a modified version of a resurrected species. The extinct Tyto Pollens was a large pre-Columbian flightless ground owl species in the Caribbean. The chickcharnie was rumored to be a supernatural variant of this bird that haunted the forests bestowing boons or curses upon travelers depending on how they treated it. The Fortean version of the chickcharnie is best described as a humanoid owl. Over one meter in height, it is bipedal but stands shorter than humans. Though winged, it is flightless except in very low grav environments and microgravity. Its wing design, however, incorporates a functional set of clawed hands. The chickcharnie is growing in popularity among neo- avians who don''t mind sacrificing flight for physical resilience, more functional hands, and a stature closely approximating transhuman standards.','podmorph',25,35,25,20000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(14,'Cloud Skate','Like the surya and hulder morphs, the cloud skate is another biomorph that pushes the edge of what is possible. It is designed to be able to live in the atmospheres of gas giants, including Jupiter. This morph is shaped roughly like a tailless stingray with a pair of slender arms. The version of the swim bladder used by this morph provides neutral buoyancy in dense atmospheres, preventing it from sinking below a safe depth. Several small outer system collectives are planning to use these morphs to colonize the atmospheres of Saturn and Neptune and are also working on creating versions of animals and plants that can also live in these exotic environments.','biomorph',30,35,55,60000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(15,'Cloud Skimmer','This streamlined synthmorph is designed for exploring the atmospheres of gas giants, but its internal rocket also allows it to operate in vacuum. This morph can travel to and from a ship in orbit around a gas giant into the planet''s atmosphere on its own. The morph is a flattened oval that can extend up to four flexible arms. The swim bladder acts much like a high pressure balloon to help keep the morph aloft in a gas giant''s dense atmosphere.','synthmorph',30,40,65,60000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(16,'Courier','This synthmorph was specifically designed to fly between the many moons and habitats in the Saturnian system. It is used by both couriers and smugglers throughout the outer system. This morph appears to be a roughly humanoid head and torso set on a conical base, with a total height of 1.5 meters, that makes it look rather like a four-armed chess piece. <br><br>\nThis base contains both the morph''s ionic propulsion system, which doubles as a plasma sail in space, and an internal rocket. This miniature metallic hydrogen rocket is specifically designed for low thrust. It provides an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, allowing the morph to take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the solar system. This engine can operate for a total of one and a half hours before it requires refueling. The morph''s four slender arms fold flat against its torso when it is in flight. Its extensive sensor suit is useful for both navigation and various covert purposes.','synthmorph',30,30,70,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(17,'Crasher','An enhanced version of ruster morphs, crashers are rugged and durable designs capable of weathering a range of harsh environments. They are the ideal biomorph for gatecrashing assignments and are popular among first-in teams. Though pricey compared to other biomorph options, many gate- crashers traveling to less habitable and dangerous environments have found the investment worth it.','biomorph',30,40,70,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(18,'Critter','Critters are pods either genetically hacked together from various animal species or simply biosculpted to appear as such. Originally popular among hyperelites who preferred smarter and distinctive AI-operated pets, they were also sometimes deployed on a covert basis as bodyguards or spies disguised as smart animals. Naturally these morphs were also embraced by people with a furry kink or who simply wanted to test-drive a body that was more bestial. Critter pods come in almost every conceivable type of animal shape, from cats to skunks to chimerical lizard-hyena hybrids. The vast majority are quadruped and stick close to the animal type''s body plan, though anthropomorphic models are also popular and there is a great deal of bodysculpted variety. A model currently popular in the inner system is the bastet, a composite of several wild cat species that resembles a tawny panther or lion, often with intricate patterns based on Egyptian hieroglyphs in their fur. Some users prefer smaller models of this morph with the Reduced Size trait (p. 93, TH).','podmorph',30,35,15,20000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(19,'Daitya','This huge, vaguely anthropomorphic synthmorph is designed for large construction projects and similar heavy industrial uses, such as moving large objects.

Modified versions have occasionally been deployed for combat purposes.','synthmorph',40,95,80,60000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(20,'Digger','Diggers are worker pods customized for archeological work. They are used for surface surveys, excavation, and general physical labor by xenoarcheological teams. Their hands are modified digging claws, adapted from the genetics of hole-digging creatures like moles and aardvarks, though still flexible and useful for grasping and fine manipulation.','podmorph',30,35,30,20000);

INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(26,'Faust','This morph is not a publicly known model. It was developed in secret by a small group of unaffiliated async genehackers. It is only available to individuals who discover a connection to this unnamed, underground async network and then download the template from one of several secret mesh sites.

INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(27,'Fenrir','Named for the monstrous wolf of Norse legend, the fenrir is one of the most imposing combat morphs ever developed. It is found only in the armed forces of the Hyoden city-state on Callisto (though black- market blueprints/copies are rumored to be available elsewhere). A massive, squat quadrupedal morph designed to be operated by up to six egos simultaneously, the fenrir is more akin to a super-heavy tank than a regular morph. <br><br>\nIt is possible that a single ego could fill all six ego slots at once through the use of alpha forks, but this has never been tested. The most common weapons mounted are linked HEAP and/or plasmaburst seeker launchers, exoatmospheric plasma beam bolters, and machine railguns loaded with AP rounds. <br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> This morph is unique in that it allows more than one ego to use it at the same time. Ego Sharing may be purchased for this morph an additional four times, for a total of five additional egos.','synthmorph',35,80,10000,60000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(28,'Fighting Kite','Based on the kite morph (p. 150, Gatecrashing) popular with gatecrashers, this morph is somewhat more durable and better armored. It also includes a built-in laser as well as anti-detection measures. Its default mode is turbofan-driven rotorcraft; its light weight allows it to fly and hover, even in thin atmospheres and heavy gravities. In streamlined ionic mode, it can travel at high speeds and maneuver in hurricane-force winds. In vacuum, it can drive itself with thrust-vector nozzles. It is occasionally used for aerial reconnaissance, but is most popular with spies, thieves, and discrete bodyguards.','synthmorph',30,30,35,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(29,'Flats','Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all of the natural defects, hereditary diseases, and other genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly applies.

INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(30,'Flexbots','Designed for multipurpose functions, flexbots can transform their shells to suit a range of situations and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multi-legged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others. Each module features its own sensor units and "bush robot" fractal-branching digits (capable of breaking into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot control computer is also distributed between modules. Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics assembly, and so on.','synthmorph',30,25,20,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(31,'Flying Squid','Given the popularity of octomorphs even among non-mercurials, morph designers have sought out a similar morph that is operable in zero g and also designed for speed. Its streamlined form resembles a stylized squid and this morph can move swiftly in both water and air. It can suck either water or air into a cavity in its mantle and then expel it out a siphon in a chosen direction for fast, jet-like propulsion. While popular with neo-octopi, its speed and overall utility has made it an increasingly favorite option with others seeking an aquatic-adapted morph.','podmorph',30,40,55,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(32,'Freeman','Many leaders want to ensure loyalty or at least obedience from their citizens, especially recently sleeved infugees. The freeman biomorph offers rulers (some would say tyrants or dictators) a chance to offer citizens a new life without worrying about dissidence. Based on the splicer morph, the freeman is genetically modified to be more obedient, which results in lower Willpower. More insidiously, freeman morphs are genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module implant (p. 197), these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego''s behavior. (The specific behavior affected is chosen with each optogenetics module implant.)<br><br>\nThe freeman comes with a specialized monitor AGI installed in a modified ghostrider module. The monitor, usually a modified fork of the tyrant''s muse, watches and reports all suspicious actions taken bythe primary ego. The purpose of this implant is often concealed. Citizens who sleeve into a freeman morph are told the implant is a security measure that helps prevent infection from TITAN technology or some similar lie. The module is designed to resist tampering and will report to headquarters the instant it detects a hacker''s intrusion. The monitor muse can manipulate the ego''s behavior or even take control of the morph via its puppet sock, but avoids doing that unless absolutely necessary. Dictators do not want to reveal that their citizens have spies implanted in their skulls, watching them.<br><br>\nSurprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve into freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.','biomorph',25,30,10,5000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(33,'Furies','Furies are combat morphs. These transgenic human upgrades feature genetics tailored for endurance, strength, and reflexes, as well as behavioralmodifications for aggressiveness and cunning.

INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(34,'Futuras','An exalt variant, futura morphs were specially crafted for the Lost generation.  Tailor-made for accelerated growth and adjusted for confidence, self-reliance, and adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhu- manity regain its foothold.

Its distinctive large head and eyes strike many transhumans as disturbing.','biomorph',30,30,25,40000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(39,'Griefer','Based on the case synthmorph design, griefers are used by vandals, terrorists, and dedicated trolls to harass enemies and antagonize the masses. Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems so they can easily harass an individual or an entire crowd. They are also typically equipped with numerous hacking tools and software aids, though they do not come with these by default. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance in some systems. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that killing a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.','synthmorph',20,20,5,1000);
INSERT INTO morphs VALUES(40,'Guard','Everyone knows that synthmorphs are tougher and better equipped for serious combat than biomorphs. However, many people in the inner system are not comfortable with using hulking synthmorphs as bodyguards or security personnel. Instead, some choose this subtle and extremely deadly alternative. This morph''s enhanced senses allow it to more easily detect any threats to the person the user is guarding, and the built-in weaponry and moderate armor make it highly resistant to damage.

In an effort to create a morph that proves their design and earns some positive reputation for their project, the creators took short cuts that caused the morph to have several distinctive and potentially annoying quirks, including an inherent need for drugs to stabilize its exotic neurochemistry. The result is a morph that is instantly recognizable by the brightly colored bony crest along the skull that helps cool its brain. Despite its quirks, the hyperbright has gained a small following among a number of scientists and engineers, especially since it has been optimized for use in the low-g environments of the outer system.

Their skin is thick, hairless, vaguely reptilian, and mostly black in color, with gold and orange body patterning. Like suryas, salamanders communicate either via wireless transmissions or by "sunspotting"--using their chromatophores to shift light and dark patterns on their skin to form patterns easily comprehensible to other coronal morphs. Salamanders have a wiry, streamlined, swept-back sort of look, a combination of fey and monkey-like. Their heads are also somewhat reptilian, with reflective eyes, no nose, and no mouth. Their feet are prehensile, usable just like hands. They lack reproductive organs and capabilities and feature cyberware gas jets on their chest and back for maneu- vering in zero g.

For exceptionally difficult terrain, the wheels can be retracted and the xu fu can maneuver as a walker. In addition to two standard arms, it features a third 2-meter long sensor-equipped limb for reaching far distances, overseeing obstacles, etc. Xu fus have an impressive sensor package and are ideal for surface-based scouting as well as investigating tunnels, collecting samples, and so on.','synthmorph',30,40,60,40000);

INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(3,'Aphasic Touch','With a touch attack, the async temporarily blocks or scrambles the language-processing centers in the target''s brain. <b>For the duration of the effect, the target cannot speak, initiate mesh actions, or otherwise communicate or read.</b>','ACT','TOUCH','temporary','complex','GAM','0','Control');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(4,'Charisma','The async uses this sleight to influence the target''s mind on a subconscious level so that the target perceives them to be charming, magnetic, and persuasive.<b> If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they gain a +30 modifier on all subsequent Social Skill Tests for the chosen duration.</b>','ACT','TOUCH','temporary','quick','GAM','-1','Control');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(5,'Cloud Memory','Cloud Memory allows the async to temporarily disrupt the target''s ability to form long-term memories. <b>If the async wins the Opposed Test, the target''s memory-saving ability is negated for the duration.</b> The target will retain short-term memories during this time, but will soon forget anything that occurred while this sleight was in effect.','ACT','TOUCH','temporary','complex','GAM','-1','Control');

INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(7,'Deep Scan','Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought Browse, made to extract information from the targeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the async telepathically invades the target''s mind and can probe it for information. <b>For every 10 full points of MoS the async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece of information.</b> Each item takes one full Action Turn to retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The target is aware of this mental probing, though they will not know what information the async acquired.','ACT','TOUCH','sustained','complex','GAM','1','Sense');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(8,'Downtime','This sleight provides the async with the ability to send the mind into a fugue-state regenerative downtime, during which the character''s psyche is repaired. The async must enter the downtime for at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals 1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements, and disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during downtime, completely oblivious to the outside world. Only severe distur- bances or physical shock (such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon) will bring the async out of it.','ACT','SELF','sustained','task','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(9,'Drive Emotion','This sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas of the target''s brain related to emotion. This allows the async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific emotions, thereby manipulating the target.<b> If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in accordance with the emotion for the duration and under certain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties (up to +/-30), as determined by the gamemaster.</b> For example, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation Test modifier against a target imbued withe fear.','ACT','TOUCH','temporary','complex','GAM','-1','Control');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(10,'Eco-Empathy','An async with this sleight can attempt to gain an intuitive understanding of non-sentient, non-terrestrial organisms occupying a producer niche in the local ecosystem (e.g., alien plant and fungus analogues). <b>If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they gain a basic understanding of the organism''s place in the local ecosystem, as well as whether it''s safe and nutritious for transhuman consumption.</b> The information gained is of a general and qualitative nature and doesn''t include any data that would normally be gained by chemical or genetic analysis. For example, an eco-empathic async could tell that a given plant thrives only in riparian zones, relies on local insect analogs for pollination, and has tubers that become edible if well cooked. They would not be able to tell that the same plant has over a thousand chromosomes, that it exudes a chemical that is physically addicting to the insects, or that the tubers contain high concentrations of a toxic lectin that breaks down and becomes harmless if boiled.','ACT','SELF','instant','Complex','CHI','-1',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(11,'Ego Sense','Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and location of other sentient and biological life forms (i.e., egos) within the async''s range. To detect these life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed by each life form within range. The async may suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and insects, similar to the modifier applied for targeting them in ranged combat likewise, a modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be applied. If successful, the async detects that the life form is nearby. <b>Every 10 full points of MoS will ascertain another piece of information regarding the detected life: direction from async, approximate size, type of creature, distance from async, etc. The async will know if the target moves, if they do so during the sleight''s duration.</b>','ACT','CLOSE','temporary','complex','GAM','-1','Sense');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(12,'Emotion Control','Emotion Control gives the async tight control over their emotional states. Unwanted emotions can be blocked out and others embraced. This has the benefit of protecting the async from emotional manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight or Intimidation skill tests. The async receives a +30 modifier when defend- ing against such tests.','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(13,'Empathic Scan','Empathic Scan enables the async to sense the target''s base emotions.<b> If the async wins the Opposed Test, they intuitively feel the target''s current emotional state for as long as the sleight is sustained.</b> At the gamemaster''s discretion, this knowledge may provide a modifier (up to +30) for certain Social skill tests.','ACT','CLOSE','sustained','quick','GAM','-2','Sense');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(14,'Enhanced Creativity','An async with Enhanced Creativity is more imaginative and more inclined to think outside the box. Apply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity can sometimes seem strange and different, manifesting in odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork.','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);

INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(16,'Grok','By using the Grok sleight, the async is able to intuitively understand how any unfamiliar object, vehicle, or device is used simply by looking at and handling it. <b>If the character succeeds in a COG Ã— 2 Test, they achieve a basic ability to use the object, vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre.</b> This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or technologies involved--the psi user simply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices, and/or tests the character is defaulting on--it does not apply to devices with which the character is familiar).','ACT','SELF','instant','complex','CHI','-1',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(17,'High Pain Threshold','This sleight allows the async to block out, ignore, or otherwise isolate pain. The async reduces negative modifiers from wounds by 10.','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(18,'Hyperthymesia','Hyperthymesia grants the async a superior auto- biographical memory, allowing them to remember the most trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be asked a random date and recall the day of the week it was, the events that occurred that day, what the weather was like, and many seemingly trivial details that most people would not be able to recall.','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(19,'Implant Memory','An async using this sleight can implant a memory of up to an hour''s length inside the target''s mind. This memory very obviously does not belong to the target--there is no way they will confuse it for one of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async''s memories in the target''s mind so that the target can access it just like any other memory. This can be useful for "archiving" important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspec- tive, or simply making a "data dump" for the target to peruse.<b> Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. </b>At the gamemaster''s discretion, particularly traumatic memories might inflict mental stress on the recipient.','ACT','TOUCH','instant','complex','GAM','0','Control');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(20,'Implant Skill','Similar to Implant Memory, this sleight allows the async to impart some of their expertise and implant it into the target''s mind. <b>For the duration of the sleight, the target benefits when using that skill. If the async''s skill is between 31 and 60, the target receives a +10 bonus. If the async''s skill is 61+, the target receives a +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants.</b> In some cases, the target has been known to use the skill with the async''s flair and mannerisms.','ACT','TOUCH','temporary','complex','GAM','0','Control');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(21,'Instinct','Instinct bolsters the async''s subconscious ability to gauge a situation and make a snap judgment that is just as accurate as a careful, considered decision.<b> For Task Actions that involve analysis or planning alone (typically Mental skill actions), the async may reduce the timeframe by 90% without suffering a modifier. For Task Actions that involve partial analysis/planning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30% without penalty.</b>','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(22,'Mimic psi','In a setting where changing your body and face is not unusual, people learn to recognize habits and personality quirks more often. The async must use this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test. If successful, the async acquires an "imprint" of the target''s mind that they can take advantage of when impersonating that ego. <b>The async then receives a +30 bonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the target''s behavior and social cues.</b>','ACT','CLOSE','instant','quick','GAM','0','Sense');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(23,'Mindlink','Mindlink allows two-way mental communication with a target. This may be used on more than one target simultaneously, in which case the async can act as a telepathic "server" so that everyone mindlinked with the async may also telepathically communicate\nwith each other (via the async, however, who over- hears). Language is still a factor in mindlinked communications, but this barrier may be overcome by transmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sensations. <b>Mindlink requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants.</b>','ACT','TOUCH','sustained','quick','GAM','1','Control');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(24,'Multitasking','The async can handle vast amounts of information without overload and can perform more than one mental task at once. The character receives an extra Complex Action each Action Phase that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(25,'Omni Awareness','An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to other biological life that is observing them. During this sleight''s duration, the async makes a Sense Test that is opposed by any life that has focused their attention on them within the sleight''s range; if successful, the async knows they are being watched, but not by whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does not register partial or fleeting attention, it only notices targets who are actively observing (even if they are concealing their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.','ACT','CLOSE','temporary','quick','GAM','-1','Sense');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(26,'Pattern Recognition','The character is adept at spotting patterns and cor- relating the non-random elements of a jumble--related items jump out at them. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or finding clues hidden among massive amounts of data. The character must have a sufficiently large sample and time enough to study, as determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens or a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or codebreaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by soft- ware to decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by half.','PAS','SELF','constant','automatic','CHI','0',NULL);
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(27,'Penetration','Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill. It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an opponent by concentrating their psi attack. <b>Every point of Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts 1 point of strain. </b>The maximum AP that may be applied equals the async''s Psi Assault skill divided by 10 (round down).','ACT','TOUCH','instant','quick','GAM','1 per AP','Psi Asault');
INSERT INTO psySleights VALUES(28,'Predictive Boost','The Bayesian probability machine features of the async''s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events.

They can identify structural vulnerabilities and weak points and focus a blast in these areas. They can determine how to blast open a safe without destroying the contents. They can focus the force of an explosion in a particular direction, increasing the directed force while minimizing splash effects.</p>\n<p>Each of these scenarios calls for a successful Demolitions Test.

A much more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs (see Planned Obsolescence, p. 165, Sunward), the genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify the morph. <br><br>Unless "unlocked" by the designer through further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph''s DNA, it is much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years.

INSERT INTO traits VALUES(7,'Alien Biochemistry','It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being trans- formed into pods by transhumance geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry''s similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. <br><br>\nWhile efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protec- tions offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regen- erate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. <br><br>\nMorphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP). <br>\n<b>This trait is only available to pods created from alien life.</b>','true',0,1,'POD');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(8,'Allies','The character is part of or has a relationship with some influential group that they can occasionally call on for support. For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the character''s relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster''s should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The character''s ties to this group are also a two-way street--they will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios).','false',30,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(9,'Ambidextrous','The character can use and manipulate objects equally well with both hands <b> (they do not suffer the off-hand modifier, as noted under Wielding Two or More Weapons).</b> If the character has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc.), this trait may be applied to a limb other than the hand. ','false',10,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(10,'Animal Empathy','The character has an instinctive feel for handling and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds. <b>Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests or whenever the character makes a test to influence or interact with an animal.</b>','false',5,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(11,'Anomalus Mind','Found almost exclusively in AGIs, uplifts, and the\nsubjects of highly experimental pyschosurgical procedures, your mental patterns are dramatically outside the norm of transhumanity. The uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup, and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform psychosurgery on the character suffer a âˆ’10 penalty and automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. <b>Also, backing up and resleeving are not automatic (pp. 268-271, EP) and require active management of the process. Any technician operating the ego bridge during such procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery Test or the backup/ sleeving attempt will fail.</b>','false',-20,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(12,'Async Familiarity','This character has a keen sense for the subtle behavioral clues and micro-expressions that many asyncs unconsciously adopt after their infection. As a result, they may make a Kinesics Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone. Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (-30) at best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs or spent significant time in their presence.','false',5,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(13,'Bad Luck','Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence, things seem to go wrong around the character. The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character''s Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character''s Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character''s friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing this trait.','false',-30,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(14,'Beta','<b>Warning ! You have to respect the limitations of this trait by yourself !</b><br><br>\nThis character is a beta fork of their original self,\nwhich for some reason is no longer alive (most likely lost during the Fall). They were created some time ago, so they have grown and overcome most of their original aptitude deficiencies. This character may not have a Moxie higher than 1 and no Active skills higher than 60, nor may they possess the Psi trait. They also have only a limited set of their original self''s memories--much of their previous life is simply lost to them. They automatically receive the Edited Memories trait (p. 149, EP), without gaining the bonus CP. Beta forks are, of course, illegal in many jurisdictions, and some consider them less than human (the gamemaster may apply a Social Stigma: Beta trait in appropriate circumstances; again no bonus CP are gained).','false',-20,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(15,'Black Mark I','At some point in the character''s past, they managed to do something that earned a black mark on their reputation.

INSERT INTO traits VALUES(20,'Botched Merge','In the past, the character suffered a serious\ncomplication during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and own identity. For some reason--perhaps due to irreproducible memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance--the decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress situations can cause periods of dissociation, amnesia, and body alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of the events around them, and/ or forget certain information, memories, or skills. In this state they suffer a âˆ’10 penalty on all tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma.','false',-15,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(21,'Botched Uplift','<b>This trait is only available to uplifts.</b><br><br> Although\npossessed of a rough self-awareness and the trappings of sapience, your mental development is flawed. Despite the best efforts of your creators and teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limita- tions and serious social awkwardness. Even psychosurgery is unlikely to fix you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your difficulties are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with you.','false',-30,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(22,'Brave','This character does not scare easily and will face threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm without flinching. As a side effect, the character is not always the best at gauging risks, especially when it comes to factoring in danger to others. <b>The character receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear or intimidation.</b>','false',10,1,'EVERY');
INSERT INTO traits VALUES(23,'Combat Paralysis','The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the character or they are surprised, the character must make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to the situation.','false',-20,1,'EVERY');

Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support.

Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines.\nThis adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph''s Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong elec- tromagnetic fields.

The player and gamemaster should work together to define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the character''s beck-and-call.

The character can usually acquire these goods or services at one cost category cheaper. This does not apply to Expensive goods. The player may use this trait as often as they wish, but the gamemaster may rule that is simply not available in certain settlements--their connection may not have a presence there or may be too strained for resources to offer the discount. Also at the gamemaster''s discretion, if the character takes actions that would substantially compromise the relationship that enables this discount, they may be temporarily unable to use this trait or may even lose it for good. <b>This trait does not reduce the cost of goods and services acquired during character creation, nor may it be taken in conjunction with the Tenure trait.</b>','false',15,1,'EVERY');

If forced into close proximity with their fear, they will suffer 1 SV per hour and take a âˆ’10 modifier to all of their actions. If they are trapped in close proximity to the source of their fear, they will suffer (1d10 Ã· 2) SV per hour and take a âˆ’30 modifier to all actions. Luckily, phobias are easier to treat than other disorders. The base timeframe for psychotherapy treatment of a phobia is 20 hours.<br><br>\nPhobia disorders may be inflicted on characters that suffer too many traumas in place of other mental disorders. Gamemasters should keep in mind, however, that phobias are easier to treat; though the possibility of taking more mental stress from the phobia may offset this. At the gamemaster''s discretion, temporary phobias can be used as derangements inflicted with mental trauma (p. 209, EP).

These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5.
