Moved to Laravel (Massive change which affected almost every part of the application):
* Database has experienced major changes (added auto incrementing id's and re-named tables)
* Javascript and CSS are now built using webpack, and injected on page load.

Removed:
* Removed the ability to buy more than one Muse/Ai
* Players may not modify anything that they have not added to their character, and removing something from their character may (in the future will) remove any modifications to that item.
